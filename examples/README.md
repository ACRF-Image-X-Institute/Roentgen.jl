# Examples

This folder contains examples on how to use Roentgen.jl.

The examples can be run in the following ways,
1. Using Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) through [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
2. Using Julia scripts (`.jl`) using the [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/)

Dependencies for the examples are specified in `Project.toml`, which can be used to set up your environment.

It is up to preference which to use: the REPL (especially with the [VS Code Julia extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia)) is more feature filled, whereas the Jupyter notebooks contain a description of what each cell does.
The Julia scripts have been generated from the notebooks using `juypter-nbconvert`.
